# 🌟 My 6-Month Tech Transformation Journey

Hey there! 👋  
I’m Beauty, a 3rd-year BCA student on a mission to level up my technical skills and build a job-ready portfolio.

This repository is where I’m documenting my full journey — week by week — as I explore:

✅ **Full Stack Development + AI Integration**  
✅ **DevOps + Cloud + System Design**  
✅ **DSA in C++** for strong problem-solving skills

## 🧭 Why This Repo?

This isn’t just about completing tutorials — it’s about:

- 💻 Building real-world projects  
- ⚙️ Learning industry-grade tools and workflows  
- 📚 Understanding systems deeply, not just memorizing  
- 🚀 Becoming truly job-ready, not just resume-ready

## 📆 Weekly Progress

I’ve divided everything into weekly modules — covering theory, projects, experiments, and reflection.  
Every commit is a piece of this growth story.
